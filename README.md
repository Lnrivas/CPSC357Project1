# Application Purpose
This is my first project in Swift. I made a playground including 3 functions, each with pseudocode in rich text. Each function solves a different problem. I chose to solve problems 1,2, and 4. Problem 1 implements a function that received as an input a natural number and return as a output true if the number is primer or false otherwise. Problem 2 writes a function that computes the time difference in minutes and hours from two given hours. Problem 4 creates a function that verifies if a text is a valid email address and if it is return the name of the user (whatever text before the @) and if not request a new email.
